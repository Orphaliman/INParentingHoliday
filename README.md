# INParentingHoliday
iOS and Android calendar app that displays the schedule of holidays as per the indiana parenting time guidelines

There should be a legend at the bottom of the screen that shows Custodial and NonCustodial with colors that represent each type of holiday
The Main Screen is a Calendar using table_calendar.dart

The app is written in Dart on Flutter. My editing software is Android Studio
